The "Images" folder is dedicated to visual assests such as maps, charts, graphs and other graphical representations used in the reports.

Organise the images into subfolders based on the corresponding reports or projects.

Provide clear filenames and consider including high-resolution and web-friendly versions of the images.

Including an "Assets" subfolder may be helpful for storing logos, icons or any other visual elements used consistently across different environmental documents.

This organisation ensures easy retrieval of visual content content for presentations, publications or further analysis.
