The "Data" folder is designed for storing raw data, datasets and any information used in the generation of environmental reports.

Organise the data into subfolders based on the type of data or project.

For Clarity, consider including a data dictioary or metadata file that explains the structure and meaning of the datasets.

This approach facilitates data transparency, allowing others to replicate analyses and draw insights from the provided information.

You may also include scripts or notebooks used for data processing and analysis in relevant subfolders.
