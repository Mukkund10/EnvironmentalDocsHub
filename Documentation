The "Documentation" folder serves as central location for project-wide documentation.

This can include project overviews, methodologies, guidelines for data collection and any other relevant information that provides context for the environmental documents.

Consider using markdown or a similar format for documentation such as "ProjectOvervieew", "Methodologies" and "Guidelines".

Well-organised documentation enhances understanding and collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
