By creating these folders and organising your environmental documents accordingly, you establish a structured and accessible repository that promotes collaboration, transparency and ease of use.

Each folder serves a specific purpose in contributing to the overall understanding of environmental initiatives, whether through detailed reports, raw data, visual representations, analysis code or comprehensive project documentation.

Regularly updating and maintaining these folders ensures that the repository remains a valuable resource for environmental rresearchers, policymakers and other stakeholders.
