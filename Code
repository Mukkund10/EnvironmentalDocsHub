The "Code" folder is meant for storing any scripts, algorithms or code used in the analysis, processing or generation of environmental data and reports.

Organise the code into subfilders based on the programming language or project.

Include README files in each subfolder explaining the purpose of the code, dependencies and instructions for usage.

This allows others to understand and potentially contribute to the codebase, promoting transparency and collaboration in the development and maintenance of environmental analysis tools.
